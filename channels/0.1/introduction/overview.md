# Channels overview

**Channels is a [Streams](root://iota-streams/0.1/introduction/overview.md) application for sending authenticated messages between two or more parties on the Tangle.**

## Why build channels

Channels comes with lots of features for communicating with other devices. The following are just a few reasons for building your own applications on Channels.

### Secure your communications

Messages can be signed and encrypted, allowing you to build applications that authenticate the sender and restrict access to private messages.

### Ensure the integrity of messages

Messages are published on the [Tangle](root://getting-started/0.1/), making them tamperproof.

### Innovate on bleeding edge technology

Channels uses quantum-robust cryptography as well as distributed ledger technology to put your applications at the forefront of innovation in these fields.
