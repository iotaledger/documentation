# Streams overview

**Streams is a cryptographic framework for building applications that stream authenticated and/or encrypted messages. Streams comes with a built-in method of sending messages to IOTA nodes, but it's also flexible enough to allow you to build applications that send messages over another medium such as IPFS.**

Here are just a few ideas of what you can build with Streams:

- An API service that encrypts data if it's behind a paywall
- A marketing subscription service that keeps an auditible record of subscriptions on the Tangle
- A secure messaging application that does not require personally identifiable information
