# Streams overview

**Streams is a cryptographic framework for building messaging applications. Streams comes with a built-in method of sending messages to IOTA nodes, but it's also flexible enough to allow you to extend it to send messages in other ways such as in HTTP URLs.**

Here are just a few ideas of what you can build with Streams:

- An API service that encrypts data if it's behind a paywall
- A marketing subscription service that keeps an auditible record of subscriptions on the Tangle
- A secure messaging application that does not require personally identifiable information

## Limitations

Streams messages are intended to be read and processed. After a message is sent, you should not rely on being able to read that message again.

## Blog posts

Read the following blog posts about Streams:

- [IOTA Streams Alpha](https://blog.iota.org/iota-streams-alpha-7e91ee326ac0)

## Repository

Go to the Streams source code on [Github](https://github.com/iotaledger/streams).
