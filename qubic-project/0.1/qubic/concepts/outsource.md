# Outsourced computations

**Using Qubic, resource-constrained devices can rely on the Tangle to process computations beyond their capabilities**

This is especially true for the devices that comprise the Internet of Things (IoT) because these devices typically have limited memory, processing power, energy availability, or all of the above.
