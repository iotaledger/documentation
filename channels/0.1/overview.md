# Channels overview

**Channels is a built-in [Streams](root://iota-streams/0.1/overview.md) protocol for building secure messaging applications.**

## Secure communications

Messages can be signed and encrypted with quantum-robust cryptography, allowing you to build secure applications.

## Ensure the integrity of messages

Messages can be published on the Tangle, making them transparent and tamperproof.

## Control access to payloads

The owner of a channel can decide who has access to private data.
