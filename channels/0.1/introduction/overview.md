# Channels overview

**Channels is a [Streams](root://iota-streams/0.1/introduction/overview.md) application for sending authenticated messages between two or more parties on the Tangle.**

With Channels, you can do the following:

- Create new channels
- Read messages on channels
- Prove that you are the owner of the channel
- Publish encrypted or plain text messages on your channel

## Why build channels

Channels come with a host of benefits for messaging applications. These are just a couple of reasons for building your own applications on Channels.

### Secure your communications

Messages in Channels can be signed and encrypted, allowing you to build applications that authenticate the sender and restrict access to private messages.

### Ensure the integrity of messages

Messages on the Tangle are unchangeable, providing your applications with built-in integrity.

### Innovate on bleeding edge technology

Channels uses quantum-robust cryptography as well as distributed ledger technology to put your applications at the forefront of innovation in these fields.
