# Streaming economies

**Oracles make a decision and deliver a result using a two phase process.  First, they commit a hidden result using a hash.   When a quorum is reached, then, they reveal the result**

There is an economic reason to split up the commit and reveal.  When oracles use resources for processing a smart contract, they take a risk of not being paid.  In order to minimize that risk, incremental payments are negotiated so oracles get paid for each piece of work. 

This provides a streaming experience for the qubic owner that allows them to pay as they go and make changes when necessary.
