# Qubic Contract

**A qubic contract is written using Abra dataflow language**  

The qubic contract outlines the work to be accomplished.  For example, in Los Angeles, food truck vendors park on local streets to sell lunch.  A qubic contract could be used to aggregate foot traffic data from local camera analytics into a profile highlighting periods of high traffic.  This information gets published to the Tangle periodically where it is available to food truck vendors.  Food truck vendors can use this data to decide where to park to maximize their profits.
