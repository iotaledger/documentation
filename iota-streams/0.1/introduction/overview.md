# Streams overview

**Streams is a cryptographic framework for building secure messaging applications. Streams comes with a built-in method of sending messages to IOTA nodes, but it's also flexible enough to allow you to extend it to send messages in other ways such as in HTTP URLs.**

Here are just a few ideas of what you can build with Streams:

- An API service that encrypts data if it's behind a paywall
- A marketing subscription service that keeps an auditible record of subscriptions on the Tangle
- A secure messaging application that does not require personally identifiable information

## Limitations

Streams messages are intended to be read and processed. After a message is sent, you should not rely on being able to read that message again.

## Blog posts

Read the following blog posts about Streams:

- [IOTA Streams Alpha](https://blog.iota.org/iota-streams-alpha-7e91ee326ac0)

## Repository

Go to the Streams source code on [Github](https://github.com/iotaledger/streams).

## Discord channels

[Join our Discord channel](https://discord.iota.org) where you can:

- Take part in discussions with IOTA developers and the community
- Ask for help
- Share your knowledge to help others

We have the following channels for Streams:

- **#streams-dev:** A read-only channel where developers discuss topics and where any GitHub updates are displayed

- **#streams-discussion:** An open channel where anyone is free to discuss Streams

## Streams Experience Team

The [Streams Experience Team](https://github.com/iota-community/IOTAStreams) (X-Team) is a collaborative effort to help improve the developer experience.

The Streams Experience Team focus on:

- Quality assurance and review
- Documentation
- Code samples

If you'd like to get involved, [add your information to an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/iota-community/IOTAStreams/issues/new/choose) and join the #experience channel on [Discord](https://discord.iota.org).
