# Channels overview

**Channels is a built-in [Streams](root://iota-streams/0.1/overview.md) protocol for building secure messaging applications that have a single owner and one or more subscribers.**

## Secure communications

Messages can be signed by the owner with quantum-robust cryptography, allowing subscribers to verify the authenticity of a message.

## Ensure the integrity of messages

Messages can be published on the Tangle, making them transparent and tamperproof. 

## Control access to masked payloads

The owner can decide which subscribers have access to certain masked payloads on the channel. The owner can also revoke that access and allow subscribers to publish their own masked payloads.
